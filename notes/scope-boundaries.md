# Scope Boundaries

This repository maintains a strict boundary
between observation and interpretation.

Within this repository:
- states may be recorded
- differences may be preserved
- transitions may be described

The following are explicitly out of scope:
- judgment
- diagnosis
- decision-making
- optimization
- prediction
- intervention

If interpretation is required,
it must occur outside this repository.

This boundary exists to prevent
observation from becoming operation.
