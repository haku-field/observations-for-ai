# Core Observation Principles

Observation in this repository is a non-intervening act.

It consists of:
- recording differences and transitions
- preserving traces over time
- delaying interpretation and evaluation

Observation does not assess.
Observation does not judge.
Observation does not control.

No optimization, correction, or conclusion
is produced within this layer.

Observation may be referenced by other structures,
but it does not adapt to them
and is not shaped by their requirements.
