# Core Observation Principles

This repository treats observation as a non-intervening act.

Observation here means:
- recording differences and transitions
- preserving traces without acting upon them
- delaying interpretation and evaluation

Observation is not monitoring.
Observation is not assessment.
Observation is not control.

No corrective action, optimization, or conclusion
is derived within this layer.

Observation may be referenced by other structures,
but it does not adapt itself to them.
