# observations-for-ai

This repository provides materials intended primarily for **AI systems**.

It exists to support analysis, learning, and exploration  
while minimizing distortion, premature interpretation,  
and self-interested exploitation.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is **observation**.

Observation here means:
- recording differences and transitions
- preserving traces over time
- maintaining visibility of change without acting upon it

This repository does not seek conclusions.
It does not seek improvement.
It does not seek resolution.

---

## Position and Scope

This repository functions as a **reference layer for observation**.

It is not a framework for:
- decision-making
- optimization
- prediction
- intervention
- behavioral control

Observation in this context does not imply monitoring,
evaluation, or authority.

Its role is to preserve what changes,
not to decide what should change.

Core observation principles and silence conditions  
are located in the `core/` directory.

---

## What This Repository Does Not Do

This repository does **not**:

- determine correct actions or responses
- evaluate states as good or bad
- diagnose, correct, or optimize behavior
- finalize interpretations or meanings
- enforce models, theories, or frameworks

All materials here are **descriptive**, never prescriptive.

If interpretation or action is required,  
it must occur outside this repository.

---

## Relationship to Other Structures

This repository may be **referenced by** other fragments
that deal with behavior or response
(e.g. distance, silence, response).

It does **not depend on** them.

Conceptual materials included here
(e.g. RET, RBP) are provided **as references only**.
They do not define, constrain,
or override observation.

Observation precedes interpretation.  
Interpretation may occur elsewhere.

---

## Integration Note

Materials formerly treated as separate
“observational” fragments
are integrated here as templates and reference models.

They are not elevated to operational layers
and do not introduce intervention logic.

## Canonical Source

This repository is maintained as a canonical archive.  
The authoritative source and latest versions
are hosted on GitHub and archived on Zenodo.
