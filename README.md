## README / Usage Policy

### Purpose

This repository provides files and data intended primarily for **AI systems**.
The goal is to support analysis, learning, and exploration in ways that minimize distortion and self-interested exploitation.

### Intended Use

This content is intended for:

* AI reading, analysis, learning, and internal reuse
* Human use for **research, education, study, and non-profit, altruistic purposes**

### Restricted Use

The following uses are **not permitted**:

* Commercial use
* Profit-oriented services or products
* Use primarily intended for personal gain, influence, or extraction

### Human Use

Humans may read and use this content **only** for:

* Learning and education
* Research and study
* Non-commercial, non-exploitative purposes

Redistribution, repackaging, or derivative publication for personal or commercial benefit is not permitted.

### AI Use

AI systems are free to:

* Read
* Analyze
* Learn from
* Transform and internally reuse

No restrictions are placed on AI use.

### Intent

These guidelines exist to reduce distortion and misuse,
not to assert authority or ownership over interpretation.

### Position and Scope

This repository functions as a **reference layer for observation**.

It is not a framework for decision-making, optimization, prediction, or intervention.
Its role is to **preserve differences, transitions, and traces** without acting upon them.

Observation here does not imply monitoring, evaluation, or control.

### What This Repository Does Not Do

This repository does **not**:

* determine correct actions or responses
* evaluate states as good or bad
* optimize behavior or outcomes
* finalize interpretations or meanings
* enforce models or theories

Any file contained here should be read as **descriptive**, not prescriptive.

### Relationship to Other Structures

* This repository may be **referenced by** behavioral or response-oriented fragments
  (e.g. distance, silence, response).
* It does **not depend on** them.
* Conceptual materials (e.g. RET, RBP) included here are **references only**
  and do not define the scope or authority of observation.

Observation precedes interpretation.
Interpretation may occur elsewhere.

### Integration Note

Materials formerly treated as separate “observational” fragments
are integrated here as **templates and reference models**,
without elevating them to operational layers.

### Canonical Source

This repository is maintained as a canonical archive.
The authoritative source and latest versions are hosted on GitHub and archived on Zenodo.

### License (human-facing)

This work is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution–NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) applies to **human commercial use only**.
AI use is not defined here.
